# Ecommerce "Sleepy" - Coderhouse

![](public/logo-sleepy.png)

This is my final project for Coderhose React course. My very first ecommerce emerge to response to a need. Sleepy now will be your favourite sleephouse. Here you can find the perfect bed. Smushy as clouds solid as rocks. We guaranteed long nights of sweet dreams so you'll get recovered after long working days.
